Dynamic libraries in C.
They are also called Shared Libraries.
These libraries are linked  at runtime and can avoid creation of multiple copies for every program.

Steps for creating Dynamic Libraries in C:
- Convert your library files to object files.
- Convert all .o to shared libraries with specific commands.
- Link and you are good to go!
